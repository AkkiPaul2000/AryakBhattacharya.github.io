            <h1>Story Of My Life</h1>
            <p>
                The contest for Portia’s hand, in which suitors from various countries choose 
                among a gold, a silver, and a lead casket, resembles the cultural and legal 
                system of Venice in some respects. Like the Venice of the play, the casket 
                contest presents the same opportunities and the same rules to men of various 
                nations, ethnicities, and religions. Also like Venice, the hidden bias of the 
                casket test is fundamentally Christian. To win Portia, Bassanio must ignore 
                the gold casket, which bears the inscription, “Who chooseth me shall gain what
                many men desire” (II.vii.5), and the silver casket, which says, “Who chooseth 
                me shall get as much as he deserves” (II.vii.7). The correct casket is lead and 
                warns that the person who chooses it must give and risk everything he has. 
                The contest combines a number of Christian teachings, such as the idea that desire 
                is an unreliable guide and should be resisted, and the idea that human beings do not 
                deserve God’s grace but receive it in spite of themselves. Christianity teaches that 
                appearances are often deceiving, and that people should not trust the evidence provided 
                by the senses—hence the humble appearance of the lead casket. Faith and charity are the 
                central values of Christianity, and these values are evoked by the lead casket’s injunction 
                to give all and risk all, as one does in making a leap of faith. Portia’s father has presented 
                marriage as one in which the proper suitor risks and gives everything for the spouse, in the 
                hope of a divine recompense he can never truly deserve. The contest certainly suits Bassanio, 
                who knows he does not deserve his good fortune but is willing to risk everything on a gamble.
